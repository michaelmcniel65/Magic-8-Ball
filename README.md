With this app, you simply ask a yes or no question and click on the ball to get a randomly selected answer (or maybe it truly is an all-seeing oracle!).

You can also choose between three preset themes: classic, cozy and forest!

Depending on what you choose, the entire theme will change accordingly.

This app was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript and is my first actual Javascript project that I wanted to create on my own.
